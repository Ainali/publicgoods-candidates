  "description": "Sunbird Obsrv comprises several pluggable tools and microservices that come together to enable observability features on any platform/solution. This includes the ability to capture granular events via telemetry, create measures, and observe various events/actions carried out by the system/users/devices (like IoT devices) on any platform/solution. Sunbird Obsrv can be utilized as an independent building block by adopters or as part of a system that employs other Sunbird building blocks. Sunbird Obsrv comes with a set of microservices, APIs, and some utility SDKs to make it easy for adopters to rapidly enable powerful data processing and aggregation infrastructure to process telemetry data, validate telemetry stream data, as well as aggregate and generate actionable insights via APIs. It also has built-in open data cataloging and publishing capability. It is built keeping extensibility in mind so that adopters have the flexibility to adapt the telemetry and tools to their specific use-cases.",

It is built keeping extensibility in mind so that adopters have the flexibility to adapt the telemetry and tools to their specific use-cases.  Capturing metrics of interest, key performance indicators, user engagement etc., as well as creating actionable dashboards are requirements that are intrinsic to any digital system. The system could be implemented in various contexts - be it energy, education, management of scarce resources or industry. Whatever be the domain, the need to observe is a key capability that can be enabled via Sunbird Obsrv. This is critical to activate and govern an ecosystem and enable trust and transparency among all participants of the ecosystem. Sunbird Obsrv can be leveraged by adopters to unearth the power of data at scale - and can enable measurements in digital systems in various societal contexts, in a reliable fashion. As a generic telemetry stream processing platform, Obsrv can be implemented across a wide variety of domains - IoT systems that need sensor data processing, telecom implementations including 5G, internet led services for shopping, entertainment or education, or even automated driving systems. Streaming telemetry event processing capabilities that Obsrv makes available can become a powerful tool for aggregation and analysis of data.  The national school education platform launched by the Ministry of Education, Government of India - DIKSHA - today reaches millions of students and teachers across the country. DIKSHA employs Sunbird Obsrv as a building block for the collation of system and user data, and the building block as of now processes over a billion events daily in a robust and reliable fashion as of today. Built for scale and reliability, Obsrv can safely be scaled to meet the required needs of the adopters.   As the world becomes data-rich, it is essential that generalized data collection and processing capabilities are made available as a pluggable building block for other applications to seamlessly use in the context of multiple domains and use-cases. Generation of telemetry across multiple systems can also be standardized so as to follow the same specs - which then allows for easy aggregation and comparison of data across the different systems. Data as a common language for different systems can go a long way to improve transparency and create robust partnerships for shared goals.  https://diksha.gov.in/about/, https://diksha.gov.in/help/diksha-oss/, https://www.sunbird.org/explore/articles/14-infosys-lex-on-adopting-sunbird, https://diksha.gov.in/assets/download/Secretary_DoSEL_Presentation_World_Bank_Webinar.pdf, https://sunbird.org/explore/articles/13-shikshalokam-on-adopting-sunbird"

This includes the ability to capture granular events via telemetry, create measures, and observe various events/actions carried out by the system/users/devices (like IoT devices) on any platform/solution. Sunbird Obsrv can be utilized as an independent building block by adopters or as part of a system that employs other Sunbird building blocks. Sunbird Obsrv comes with a set of microservices, APIs, and some utility SDKs to make it easy for adopters to rapidly enable powerful data processing and aggregation infrastructure to process telemetry data, validate telemetry stream data, as well as aggregate and generate actionable insights via APIs. It also has built-in open data cataloging and publishing capability. It is built keeping extensibility in mind so that adopters have the flexibility to adapt the telemetry and tools to their specific use-cases.  Capturing metrics of interest, key performance indicators, user engagement etc., as well as creating actionable dashboards are requirements that are intrinsic to any digital system. The system could be implemented in various contexts - be it energy, education, management of scarce resources or industry. Whatever be the domain, the need to observe is a key capability that can be enabled via Sunbird Obsrv. This is critical to activate and govern an ecosystem and enable trust and transparency among all participants of the ecosystem. Sunbird Obsrv can be leveraged by adopters to unearth the power of data at scale - and can enable measurements in digital systems in various societal contexts, in a reliable fashion. As a generic telemetry stream processing platform, Obsrv can be implemented across a wide variety of domains - IoT systems that need sensor data processing, telecom implementations including 5G, internet led services for shopping, entertainment or education, or even automated driving systems. Streaming telemetry event processing capabilities that Obsrv makes available can become a powerful tool for aggregation and analysis of data.  The national school education platform launched by the Ministry of Education, Government of India - DIKSHA - today reaches millions of students and teachers across the country. DIKSHA employs Sunbird Obsrv as a building block for the collation of system and user data, and the building block as of now processes over a billion events daily in a robust and reliable fashion as of today. Built for scale and reliability, Obsrv can safely be scaled to meet the required needs of the adopters.   As the world becomes data-rich, it is essential that generalized data collection and processing capabilities are made available as a pluggable building block for other applications to seamlessly use in the context of multiple domains and use-cases. Generation of telemetry across multiple systems can also be standardized so as to follow the same specs - which then allows for easy aggregation and comparison of data across the different systems. Data as a common language for different systems can go a long way to improve transparency and create robust partnerships for shared goals.  https://diksha.gov.in/about/, https://diksha.gov.in/help/diksha-oss/, https://www.sunbird.org/explore/articles/14-infosys-lex-on-adopting-sunbird, https://diksha.gov.in/assets/download/Secretary_DoSEL_Presentation_World_Bank_Webinar.pdf, https://sunbird.org/explore/articles/13-shikshalokam-on-adopting-sunbird"
