  "description": "Sunbird Lern is primarily a set of microservices along with some reference UX widgets that offer capabilities to enable tracking of a user’s learning journey as well as enable interactions and collaboration among users. These capabilities can be leveraged by any adopter with requirements for measurement of learning progress, creation and management of cohorts/ batches of learners, as well as enabling collaboration capabilities such as Groups or Discussion forums. The Lern services are also employed for creation and management of user accounts and organisations within a Sunbird instance.",

Sunbird is part of the Digital Public Goods Registry of the DPGA, and powers several national level initiatives in India.  Sunbird Lern is a software building block that offers capabilities that enable tracking of a user’s learning journey as well as enables interactions and collaboration among users by providing various sets of tools and microservices. These capabilities can be leveraged by any adopter with requirements for measurement of learning progress, creation and management of cohorts/ batches of learners, as well as enabling collaboration capabilities such as Groups or Discussion forums. The Lern services are also employed for the creation and management of user accounts and organisations within the Sunbird instance.  Sunbird building blocks enable access to learning opportunities to anyone, anytime, anywhere, and are designed for scale and to meet diverse learning needs. Sunbird Lern capabilities, as with all Sunbird building blocks, are created keeping in mind the specific need to evolve solutions that work to address scale, diversity and complexity - to ensure access and opportunity to all. By catering to diverse scenarios and user types, programs rolled out using Sunbird ensure inclusive and equitable access to all - including users with special needs.  Sunbird building blocks have been adopted by the Ministry of Education, Government of India to launch a national school education platform called DIKSHA. DIKSHA has been used extensively in each of the 36 States and Union Territories in India across 30+ languages. Through DIKSHA (which is built completely on Sunbird ED), millions of students, teachers, parents, educational leaders, and the community in India are accessing learning opportunities. During Covid-19 it has proven to be an instrumental large scale platform for maintaining learning continuity. Sunbird (in full or partial) has also been also adopted by a few other Government and private sector projects. The need for learning and human development is spread across all domains. Energy, water conservation and sanitation (Arghyam) and Industry and innovation (Lex, Shikshalokam) are just some examples of domains where Sunbird Lern has been successfully leveraged to create an impact at scale.     Sunbird building blocks can be used by various adopters for school education, teacher development, school administration and school leadership development, upskilling mid-career professionals, financial literacy, technical training, and other areas related to learning and overall human development in order to improve prospects of earning a livelihood, improving economic conditions, and lifestyle of a large population. Sunbird with its building block approach enables adopters to roll out open platforms as public infrastructure and enable the ecosystem to innovate leveraging the building blocks.  https://diksha.gov.in/about/ , https://diksha.gov.in/help/diksha-oss/ , https://www.sunbird.org/explore/articles/14-infosys-lex-on-adopting-sunbird , https://diksha.gov.in/assets/download/Secretary_DoSEL_Presentation_World_Bank_Webinar.pdf , https://sunbird.org/explore/articles/13-shikshalokam-on-adopting-sunbird"
