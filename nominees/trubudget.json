As a result, official development assistance (ODA) becomes more targeted and measures are taken more effectively. By reducing transaction costs, more funds are ultimately available for the implementation of development-relevant measures, contributing to SDG1 (and other SDGs which rely on the use of funds for their progress) indirectly.",
