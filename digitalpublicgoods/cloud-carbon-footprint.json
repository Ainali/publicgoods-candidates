        "We interpret this question to refer to the software offering itself, in which case the project/tool does not enable interactions between users.  However, because the offering is an open-source project, the project team at Thoughtworks has enabled community involvement and discussion groups for interested stakeholders to exchange input and contribute to open-source code. TW has put in place a code of conduct (https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  and guidelines for community discussion and monitors the discussion regularly.  As a monitor of the github and discussion groups, TW reviews all issues and messages. We do this ensuring that our code of conduct is followed in all interactions."
