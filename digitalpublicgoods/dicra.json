The platform uses and generates data analysis on natural resources impacting agriculture (soil, water, land, meteorological conditions etc.) and markets (price fluctuations of agriculture commodities). The meta data standards, data methodology and analytics are transparently shared on the platform for consumption and feedback by stakeholders in agriculture. Given the non-PI nature of data used and generated by the platform, coupled with transparency & accountability mechanisms built into the design, the risk of harm is reduced significantly.
