For example, Harmony can enable geographic triangulations across logistic management information systems (e.g.LMIS) and routine health systems (e.g. DHIS2).\n\nThere are mechanisms for both importing and extracting data from Harmony using non-proprietary formats: \nImporting data into Harmony: This project comes with a built-in ETL pipeline that has been proven to work in a variety of global health contexts. It provides a general framework for scraping data from any number of data sources or APIs, tools for standardizing this data into a common format (called Base Format), and libraries for merging these disparate datasets together to make them mutually queryable. The data pipeline is based on Zeus, an open-source, no-frills, command-line oriented pipeline runner.\n\n\nExtracting data: Harmony registered users can flexibly extract data from the platform in a number of ways. By using the analytics front-end, users can download query data in Excel, CSV, XML and ADX data formats. In addition, technical users can query the Druid open-source database directly by writing Druid database SQL queries or native Druid JSON-based queries. \n\n"

      "Yes, the configuration of the platform is flexible and administrators are able to adjust how the platform operates to abide by local laws and requirements.  Access to Protected Data at the indicator level, dashboards, analyses, and other functionalities can be managed on a per-user basis. Harmony administrators are responsible for determining the appropriate levels of access each user shall have at the highest level of granularity. For example, in South Africa, Harmony users configured the platform to respect the Protection of Personal Information (POPI) act.   In addition, Harmony does not collect any personal information about users other than their sign-in information. "

      "The Harmony project supports common standards across the software stack:  Web server:  Front-end interface: HTML, CSS, Javascript   Harmony's frontend interface is built in React.js, and as a Flask app, Harmony serves this frontend via HTML template files such as https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony/blob/master/web/server/templates/layout.html  Display styling is created using Sass, a CSS preprocessor. As an example, the following file dictates how the navigation bar on the platform looks: https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony/blob/master/web/public/scss/components/navbar/_navbar.scss    Server-side: Python   Web data exchange:    HTTPS protocol: The Harmony project is built in a client-server architecture that manages requests through HTTPS. Frontend requests are generated by the APIService class (see link) and then forwarded to the Python web server. https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony/blob/master/web/client/services/APIService.js    REST APIs: Harmony utilizes the Flask-Potion extension to build RESTful JSON APIs on the backend. API endpoints are organized by product in the `web/server/api` directory.  For example, the following file contains the REST API schema for the dashboard app:  https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony/blob/master/web/server/api/dashboard_api_models.py    Data import & export:   Data import: Harmony supports importing data in a variety of formats. The process_csv script (https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony/blob/master/data/pipeline/scripts/process_csv.py) allows for easy ingestion of data in the CSV format.    Data export: Harmony supports a large variety of export types including CSV, JSON, ADX and ISO 3166.  https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony/blob/master/web/client/components/AdvancedQueryApp/LiveResultsView/QueryResultActionButtons/ShareQueryModal/DownloadDataTab.jsx  In addition, there are plans to support additional import and export data exchange standards on the Harmony roadmap, in order to further facilitate data exchange between software applications in a countryâ€™s data ecosystem. For example: support for FHIR-based import and export of data from systems supporting FHIR Resources (e.g. openMRS). "

      "Zenysis uses agile project methodologies to implement its software, including for Harmony, and has successfully completed all of its integration, analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and modeling projects using agile principles. For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN). The project is built with a robust translation and localization library that enables users to translate any content.   Consistent style guidelines: Linters are used to maintain consistent style and naming conventions that adhere to the best practices for the respective language.   Immutable data models: ZenModels are our well-documented, internal immutable data models. They are used to maintain immutability with React.   Privacy and security  Data Encryption in Transit: all communication between users of the Harmony platform and the server is encrypted with TLS. Servers should support TLS 1.3, Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. This ensures that no Protected Data will leave servers in an unencrypted state.  Data Encryption at Rest: Protected Data stored on configured servers is encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard 128 (AES-128). Users are automatically logged out of their user session after 30 minutes of inactivity by default. "

Furthermore, at the user level, unique identifiers and passwords are given to each user with specific accessibility guardrails that are defined by key stakeholders overseeing any instance of Harmony. Users are also automatically logged out of their user session after 30 minutes of inactivity by default.   Given Harmony is open source and may be used freely, if Zenysis is not supporting the Harmony implementation/utilization, we expect organizations to also establish their own data and privacy risk mitigation efforts, beyond what is already offered in the software, in accordance with any applicable local laws or best practices."
